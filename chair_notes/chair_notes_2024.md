  by @TallTed but were promptly addressed by @woutermont in
  [comment][20240129_2], which in turn was ack'ed by @TallTed with a +1.

## 2024-01-31

- Merged [#55][20240131_1] as it fixes an issue with [#45][20240129_1] that we
  had not foreseen (redundant runs of the BikeShed build process that were 
  polluting the commit history with too many CI commits). No deadline, I merged
  this one right away as it's just a fix to something that had been previously
  discussed and agreed upon.

## 2023-02-05

- Merged [#52][20240205_1] as today was the deadline for its review, no
  objections have been raised and it has been reviewed and ack'ed by members of
  the group.
- Merged [#56][20240205_2] as today was the deadline for its review, no
  objections have been raised and multiple participants have contributed to it.
    - Note that @melvincarvalho might have a strong objection.
    - Note that @webr3 would rather we focus on creating new documents rather
      than iterating on the current ones. However, the majority of this group
      prefers the latter.
