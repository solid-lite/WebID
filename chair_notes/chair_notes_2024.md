## 2024-01-29

- Merged [#45][20240129_1] as today was the deadline for its review and no
  objections have been raised. Some concerns about workflow have been raised
  by @TallTed but were promptly addressed by @woutermont in
  [comment][20240129_2], which in turn was ack'ed by @TallTed with a +1.
- Sent out [new instance of chair's overview][20240129_3] to the mailing list.

## 2024-01-31

- Merged [#55][20240131_1] as it fixes an issue with [#45][20240129_1] that we
  had not foreseen (redundant runs of the BikeShed build process that were 
  polluting the commit history with too many CI commits). No deadline, I merged
  this one right away as it's just a fix to something that had been previously
  discussed and agreed upon.
