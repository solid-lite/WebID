# Chair's notes - 2024

## 2024-01-29

- Merged [#45][20240129_1] as today was the deadline for its review and no
  objections have been raised. Some concerns about workflow have been raised
  by @TallTed but were promptly addressed by @woutermont in
  [comment][20240129_2], which in turn was ack'ed by @TallTed with a +1.
- Sent out [new instance of chair's overview][20240129_3] to the mailing list.
